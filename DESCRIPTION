Description: Utility functions for mutational signature analysis
             as described in Alexandrov, L. B. (2020)
             <doi: 10.1038/s41586-020-1943-3>.
             This package provides two groups of functions. One is
             for dealing with mutational signature "exposures"
             (i.e. the counts of mutations in a sample that are
             due to each mutational signature). The other group of
             functions is for matching or comparing sets of 
             mutational signatures. mSigTools' stands for 
             mutational Signature analysis Tools.
