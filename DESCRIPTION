Description: Utility functions for mutational signature analysis.
             This package provides two groups of functions. One is for
             dealing with mutational signature "exposures" (i.e. the
             counts of mutations in a sample that are
             due to each mutational signature). The other group of
             functions is for matching two sets of mutational
             signatures. The match minimizes the total distance
             between paired signatures by using the "Hungarian 
             algorithm" described in : 
             Kuhn, H. W. (1955) <doi:10.1002/nav.3800020109>.
             'mSigTools' stands for mutational Signature analysis Tools.
